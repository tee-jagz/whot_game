# whot_game

## Introduction
This a mini project I used to learn the OOP paradigm. The initial deliverable is a card game that can be played on the terminal adopting rules similar (but not the same) to the traditional whot game.
NOTE: I decided not to add GUI as I believe I was able to achieve my purpose of starting the project.

### Interface
The game is played on the terminal terminal with the with the programme always requesting an input from the player. On running the game, the initial output looks as below
```
